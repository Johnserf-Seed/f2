# Installation

## Prerequisites

### **Programming Languages**
   - [Python](https://www.python.org/) â‰¥ `3.10`, recommended version `3.11.1`, required to run `F2`.
   - [Nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) â‰¥ `1.1.12`, used to manage `Node.js` versions, which some `F2` applications depend on.
### **Terminal**
   - [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) â‰¥ `1.21.3231.0`, required for command line interface (`CLI`).
### **Version Control Tools**
   - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) â‰¥ `2.47.0.2` or []
   - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) â‰¥ `3.4.12`, used for visual management of `Git` projects.
### **Text Editors**
   - A text editor that supports [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/python) syntax. If you are a beginner, it is recommended to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) â‰¥ `1.96.2` or [VSCode Online](https://vscode.dev), as they are lightweight and have rich plugins.
### **Browsers**
   - Popular browsers such as [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge), etc., for viewing documentation and debugging.
### **Network Environment**
   - A stable network environment for installing dependencies and collecting data.
### **Other**
   - Knowledge of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) syntax for editing documentation.
   - Knowledge of [YAML](https://yaml.org/) syntax for editing configuration files.
   - Understanding of [asynchronous programming](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) documentation to grasp `F2`'s asynchronous features.
   - Read [Developer Guide](/guide/what-is-f2) for detailed developer documentation on `F2`.

> [!TIP] What else is needed? ðŸ¤”

## Package Manager Installation

`F2` can be used alone or installed in an existing project. In both cases, you can install it in different versions using the following commands:

::: code-group

```sh [Windows]
$ pip install f2                # Install the latest version
$ pip install f2==x.x.x.x       # Install a specific version
$ pip install -U f2             # Upgrade to the latest version
$ pip uninstall f2              # Uninstall
```

```sh [Linux]
$ pip3 install f2                # Install the latest version
$ pip3 install f2==x.x.x.x       # Install a specific version
$ pip3 install -U f2             # Upgrade to the latest version
$ pip3 uninstall f2              # Uninstall
```

```sh [MacOS]
$ pip3 install f2                # Install the latest version
$ pip3 install f2==x.x.x.x       # Install a specific version
$ pip3 install -U f2             # Upgrade to the latest version
$ pip3 uninstall f2              # Uninstall
```

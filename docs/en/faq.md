# Common Issues and Solutions

## Empty Response on the nth Request

An empty response on the nth request is related to `cookie` settings.

::: details :link: Solution
1. Check the `cookie` value in the `app` configuration file for incorrect characters (e.g., newlines, spaces, non-ASCII characters).
2. The Douyin web `cookie` has over `60` keys, while TikTok's web `cookie` has fewer than `30`. A short `cookie` will likely cause issues.
3. When using `--auto-cookie`, ensure the browser is logged in with a normal account, as guest account cookies are unstable.
4. If you used QR code login in the app, the cookie might expire due to device environment risk control. Re-generate the `cookie` with `--auto-cookie`.
5. In versions before `0.0.1.2`, custom config file `cookies` may not be recognized correctly.

`Cookie` retrieval method: See the image below.

## API Rate Limit Error

If you encounter `API Rate Limit Error`, simply wait and retry. This error is caused by too frequent requests being throttled by the server.

If it continues, log in again on the web and retrieve a new `cookie`. If still ineffective, switch networks or accounts.

## <urlopen error [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed>

This issue is related to local network connection problems. Check if your network and `DNS` are functioning correctly. Ensure your proxy is properly configured.

## f2: command not found

On `non-Windows` systems, if you encounter `f2: command not found`, it means the `f2` command is not in your system’s PATH.

::: details :link: Solution
Run `which f2` to find the path of `f2` and add it to your environment variable.
1. Edit the `~/.bashrc` file to add `export PATH="$PATH:/home/YOUR_NAME/.local/bin"`.
2. Run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.
3. Reopen the terminal and use the `f2` command.

## WARNING: No matching works were found

If you see `WARNING: No matching works were found`, check if you have configured the `interval` parameter correctly.

::: details :link: Solution
1. Ensure `interval: all` is set if the `interval` parameter is missing.
2. If `interval` is present, verify its value.
3. The `-i` flag also sets the content filter. Set it to `-i all`.
4. If you use `-i`, ensure it's configured correctly.

## EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:992)

This indicates an SSL handshake failure.

Non-project issue, multiple possible causes need investigation.

::: details :link: Solution
1. Check if your proxy settings are correct and not blocking the `SSL/TLS` handshake.
2. Ensure a stable proxy connection.
3. Use more professional proxy tools.
4. Switch networks.
5. Try changing `DNS` servers.
6. If the issue is related to the `httpx` library version, try downgrading `httpx`.
7. If using tools like `Postman` or `curl` can access the API but the project times out, see item `6`.
:::

## _ssl.c:975 The handshake operation timed out

This indicates an `SSL` handshake timeout, often caused by unstable network connections or high latency.

Non-project issue, requires investigation.

::: details :link: Solution
1. Ensure stable network connection and low latency.
2. Check server status for responsiveness.
3. Verify firewall and proxy settings.
4. Adjust timeout settings.

## tiktok 403 Forbidden

A `403 Forbidden` error when downloading TikTok videos occurs due to the `device_Id`being banned.

Device IDs are tied to `cookies`, and a banned device ID results in invalid cookies.

::: details :link: Solution
1. Regenerate the `device_Id`.
2. Replace the old `device_Id` in the config file with the new one.
3. Incrementally update the `cookie` values in the config file, rather than overwriting them.
4. Retry the download command.

## TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()

You may see errors like this in the terminal:

```shell
Due to API updates, some fields failed:
Field weibo_read_count: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
Field weibo_topic_title: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
```

This occurs when the API field has changed and no longer exists or is different.

::: details :link: Please report the issue in the Issue tracker with the following information:
1. Debug logs (`f2 -d DEBUG [app_name]`):
    - Complete error message and context.
2. A description of the problematic fields:
    - Clearly indicate which fields are problematic and may need updating.
3. Simplified response data structure (optional):
    - Provide the approximate location of the fields in the API response.

Once feedback is received, the issue will be addressed in the next version, or you can submit a PR.

## twitter 403 Forbidden

A `403 Forbidden` error when downloading Twitter posts is caused by an expired `cookie` or `X-Csrf-Token`.

::: details :link: Solution
1. Regenerate the `cookie` and `X-Csrf-Token`.
2. Update the `cookie` and `X-Csrf-Token` in the config files.
3. Retry the download command.

The `X-Csrf-Token` is in the `F2 config file (conf.yaml)`, while the cookie is in the app's main or custom config files.

## Installing build dependencies error

When installing dependencies, you may encounter an error like this:
```shell
  × pip subprocess to install build dependencies did not run successfully.
  │ exit code: 1
      Looking in indexes: https://xxxx
      ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement hatchling (from versions: none)
      ERROR: No matching distribution found for hatchling
      [end of output]

  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
```

This error occurs because `pip` cannot find the build dependencies.

::: details :link: Solution
1. Switch to the official PyPI source:

```shell
pip config unset global.index-url
```
2. Reinstall the project:

```shell
pip install f2
```
or

```shell
pip install -e .
```
